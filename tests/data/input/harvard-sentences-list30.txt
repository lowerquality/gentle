The mute muffled the high tones of the horn.
The gold ring fits only a pierced ear.
The old pan was covered with hard fudge.
Watch the log float in the wide river.
The node on the stalk of wheat grew daily.
The heap of fallen leaves was set on fire.
Write fast, if you want to finish early.
His shirt was clean but one button was gone.
The barrel of beer was a brew of malt and hops.
Tin cans are absent from store shelves.
